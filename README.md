# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis (Power BI)
data analytics & dashboard project analyzing customer shopping behavior.
The goal is to explore patterns in customer purchases, demographics, purchase frequency, and spending trends, and present insights using Python for analysis and Power BI for visualization.

# About the Data
The dataset is used to analyze customer behavior trends, purchasing frequency, and spending patterns,
and to support data visualization and dashboard creation in Power BI.

| promo_code_used            | Indicates whether a promo code was used              |

# Tools:
- Python (Pandas)
- Power BI (DAX)

# 🧠 Workflow:
1. Data Cleaning (Python)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Dashboard & KPI Analysis (Power BI)

## 📊 What’s Inside

### 🔹 Data Cleaning
- Rename, format, and standardize columns
- Feature engineering (age groups, purchase frequency)
- Save cleaned version for analysis

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Purchase amount distribution
- Customer demographics
- Grouping by gender & age-related patterns
- Discount and promo code checks

**Notes:**
- The dataset is used for learning and portfolio purposes.
- Categorical variables were cleaned and standardized during preprocessing.
- Some columns were transformed or removed during EDA for redundancy reduction.
